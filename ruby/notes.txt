Notes for Ruby Chapter

Created in 1993.

Interpreted, object-oriented, dynamically-typed languages.

combination of Lisp, Smalltalk and Perl.

Programming model

pure object-oriented: everything is an object.
true and false are first-class objects.

while/until still are alien to me in Ruby. I haven't used them in a long time; I never really used them extensively.

&& and || short-circuit
& and | don't


HAHA! Ruby is a block party!
